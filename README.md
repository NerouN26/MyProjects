# MyProjects
Here will be my scripts and bot codes, as well as various experiments.
Subsequently, I will start adding real projects, but in the meantime I am undergoing training worked from MySql and GitHub.

# Internet_Cafe_bot
### Link internet cafe bot: [Internet_cafe_nekita_bot](http://t.me/Internet_cafe_nekita_bot)

Internet_cafe_bot is my first fake project to demonstrate skills.

### he:
* Receive, process and send information to specified users.
* Processes values from keyboard
* Has its own project on [repl.it ](https://replit.com /) and a monitor on the service [UpTimerRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to bypass the algorithm repl.it by sending requests to a running script. This resets the counter before disabling the script and makes it work 24/7.
* It can be updated and improved at any time
