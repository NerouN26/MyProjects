Internet_cafe_bot is my first fake project to demonstrate skills.

### he:
* receives, processes and sends information to specified user.
* Processes values from keyboard.
* Has its own project on [repl.it](https://replit.com/) and a monitor on the service [UpTimerRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to bypass the algorithm repl.it by sending requests to a running script. This resets the counter before disabling the script and makes it work 24/7.
* It can be updated and improved at any time.
