## Idea

This is my autobiographical novel, in which the plot is based on a real event, embellished with genre stylistics and some cliches.

At the time of the narration, my friend Dima and I were 14 years old. The key location in the plot was the so-called "Mountain", which was formed as a result of the foundation of a sand quarry in our area. It became a key location because it had an unusual environment for the city, there was a real natural oasis among the bustle of the city. In the summer there was a lot of grass and high straw, looking at what from a certain angle it seemed that you were far away from the city.

At the very beginning, it was conceived as a small story that could be cheerfully presented to our classmates in the form of a novella. But then I decided not to abandon it and turn it into a real memoir about my significant events in life.

## Thoughts on adding DLS

As mentioned earlier, I didn't want to give up this novel, and so I decided to make various DLCs, each of which will have one significant event in my life. I decided to do them as events unfolded, and accordingly I started from the earliest years of my life.
